# üëã üëã Welcome to the 2021 Statistical Society of Canada Data Science and Analytics Workshop 
## The Data Scientist‚Äôs Workflow: EDA and Statistical Modeling with Python in Jupyter Notebooks

üìÜ 12 June 2021 

‚è≤Ô∏è 13:00 - 16:00 <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>


**What's in this repository?** This repository contains Jupyter notebook files that we will cover during the workshop.  

**How can I run these Jupyter notebooks?** Click on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ssc-datascience/pythonjupyter_wshop2021/HEAD) to open the Jupyter notebooks in this repository in an executable envirnonment.

**Do I need to install any software to follow the workshop?** No. We are using <https://mybinder.org> to allow you to open the notebooks in this repo in an executable environment, so that you can reproduce all the material yourself. Although, if you have Python, and the Python [libraries](/binder/requirements.txt) we are using installed on your computer then you can download the files (or clone this repo) and run the notebooks on your own computer.
